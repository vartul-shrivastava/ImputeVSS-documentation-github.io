Installation
============

This section provides a detailed guide to setting up and installing ImputeVSS on your local system. Follow the instructions carefully to ensure a smooth setup and avoid potential issues.

System Requirements
-------------------

Before installing ImputeVSS, ensure that your system meets the following prerequisites:

1. Python 3.12 or higher  
   - Python serves as the core programming language for ImputeVSS.  
   - Download and install the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Ollama Desktop
   - Install Ollama from https://ollama.com/ and ensure it is running on your system. Also install python package of Ollama in your environment.

Dependencies
------------

ImputeVSS relies on a range of Python libraries for its core functionalities. These libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install the dependencies using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Key Dependencies
-----------------

The primary libraries required for ImputeVSS include:

- Flask: A lightweight web framework for building the web interface.
- pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: Provides support for numerical operations and array processing.
- scikit-learn: Implements advanced imputation methods such as KNN and MICE.
- scipy: Supports statistical computations for analysis.
- ollama: Enables integration with AI models for generating imputation recommendations.

For a complete list of dependencies, refer to the `requirements.txt` file included in the project.

File Structure
--------------

Organize your project directory as follows to maintain clarity and enable seamless development:

.. code-block:: text

   imputevss/
   ├── app.py                # Main application file
   ├── requirements.txt      # Dependency list
   ├── static/               # Static files (CSS, JS, images)
   │   ├── css/              # Stylesheets for the UI
   │   ├── js/               # JavaScript files
   │   ├── images/           # Images and logos
   └── templates/            # HTML templates
       ├── index.html        # Main HTML page

Step-by-Step Installation Guide
-------------------------------

Follow these steps to set up ImputeVSS:

1. Clone the Repository from GitHub.

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)  
   A virtual environment ensures isolation of dependencies for the project.

   .. code-block:: bash

      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate      # On Linux/Mac
      venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows

3. Install Dependencies  
   Install all required libraries by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Verify Installation  
   Test that all dependencies are correctly installed by starting the Flask application:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python app.py

   You should see an output indicating that the application is running (e.g., "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"). Open this URL in your web browser to access ImputeVSS.

Optional Steps
--------------

Configuring AI Integration with Ollama
--------------------------------------

1. Ensure that Ollama is installed on your system.  

2. Verify that Ollama is running by executing in your environment console:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ollama list

   If the command outputs a list of models, Ollama is configured correctly.

3. Pull the model(s) from Ollama by running:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ollama pull <model-name>

3. In the ImputeVSS interface, use the "Check AI Dependency" button to confirm integration.

Customizing the Application
---------------------------

- You can modify the Flask configuration (e.g., secret keys, upload folders) in the `app.py` file to suit your requirements.
- For front-end customization, edit the files in the `static/` and `templates/` directories.

Troubleshooting Installation
----------------------------

1. Missing Dependencies  
   If any required library fails to install:
   - Ensure that Python and pip are correctly installed and updated.
   - Run `pip install <package_name>` to manually install the missing dependency.

2. Flask Server Not Starting  
   - Check for errors in the terminal.
   - Ensure the correct Python version is being used.
   - If you are using a virtual environment, activate it before running the application.

3. Ollama Errors  
   - Ensure Ollama is installed and running on your system.
   - Use the "Check AI Dependency" feature to verify connectivity.

Once all steps are completed, you are ready to use ImputeVSS for data imputation and analysis!
